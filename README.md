Solution: not yet up

To use the program, compile it with the Makefile and run: ./grid positive_integer

The positive_integer argument is the length of the grid as well as the number of tokens on it.
Note that the submittable part of the puzzle has length/num_tokens = 6.

The program will draw all the grids it finds that match the correct solution.
