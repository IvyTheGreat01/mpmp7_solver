This C program solves Matt Parker's Math Puzzle 7

Puzzle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_YOCQaI5QI&feature=emb_logo

Solution: not yet up

To use the program, compile it with the Makefile and run: ./grid n

The 'n' argument must be greater than 1 and is the length of the grid as well as the number of tokens on it.
Note that the submittable part of the puzzle has length/num_tokens = 6.

The program will draw all the grids it finds that match the correct solution.

Number of correct solutions found by the program (should be all possible solutions including rotations/reflections):

n=2 : 6

n=3 : 40

n=4 : 184

n=5 : 280

n=6 : 16

n=7 : 8

n>7 : 0
